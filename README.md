Introduction
Embarking on the path to mastering coding challenges, I decided to tackle LeetCode problems to sharpen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. This repository is a testament to my progress, where I share my solutions, thought processes, and learnings.

Journey So Far
Starting with the basics, I gradually moved on to more complex problems. Each solution here represents a step forward in my coding journey. From struggling with the initial problems to gaining confidence with more challenging ones, this repository captures my growth and persistence.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized to help you navigate through the solutions easily:

Easy/: Solutions to easy problems
Medium/: Solutions to medium problems
Hard/: Solutions to hard problems
Each folder contains subfolders for different problem types, such as arrays, strings, linked lists, etc.

How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Cryptonal/Coding-problems-practice
Navigate to the problem category and difficulty level you're interested in.
Open the solution file to view the problem statement and code.
